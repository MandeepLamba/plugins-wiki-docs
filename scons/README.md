This plugin allows Hudson to invoke [SCons](http://www.scons.org/) build
script as the main build step.  
  
  

# Configurations

## Project Configuration

The plugin works much like Ant builder, and using it is very easy. You
basically just need to specify the SCons options, variables and targets
build script that you want to run:

## Global Configuration

If 'scons' is not in PATH, or if you have multiple SCons installations
and need to be able to configure which project uses which SCons, then
you can go to the system configuration and tell Hudson where your Gradle
are:
