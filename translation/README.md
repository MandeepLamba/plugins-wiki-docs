**The server handling submitted translations has been shut down.** While
this plugin is still useful for local translations, it's not possible to
submit translations to the Jenkins project anymore.

Older versions of this plugin may not be safe to use. Please review the
following warnings before using an older version:

-   [Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
    vulnerability](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2018-01-22/)

This plugin adds an additional dialog box in every page, which enables
people to contribute localizations for the messages they are seeing in
the current page.This reduces the barrier of entry to localization, and
by showing messages in the context of a page, it should also improve the
quality of the translation.

## How does it work?

Browse any page of Jenkins, and you'll see a link in the footer section
that opens the translation dialog.  
![](docs/images/l10n-link.png)

Click this link, and you'll see an inline dialog box.  
![](docs/images/l10n-dialog.png)

Choose the locale that you'd like to contribute, then type the
translation text. The message follows the format of
[`MessageFormat`](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html),
and in particular,

1.  Markers like "{0}" and "{1}" represent the arguments
2.  Single quote (') needs to be escaped as two single-quote ('')

    Your name allows us to recognize your contributions and bypass
    manual review, especially when you've been contributing in the past.
    So do supply some unique string, even if it's not your real name.

    If you have an administrative access to the Jenkins instance, your
    contributions will be reflected right away â€” just reload the page to
    see the effect. (If you do not have the access, your changes won't
    be reflected to the running instance for security reasons, but
    nonetheless they are sent to the Jenkins server.)

Your contributions are also sent to the Jenkins project for inclusion in
future versions of Jenkins.
