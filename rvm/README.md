This plugin runs your jobs in the [RVM](http://rvm.io/) managed
ruby+gemset of your choice.

# Features

-   Runs your entire build (from SCM check out to post-build actions)
    within the context of an RVM managed environment of your choice (as
    opposed to your doing "source \~/.rvm/scripts/rvm && rvm foo@bar",
    which only affects your current shell)
-   If the Ruby/gemset you specified doesn't exist on a slave that the
    build is running, it'll be automatically installed and created (via
    `rvm_install_on_use_flag`)

# Configuration

Once this plugin is installed, you'll see the "Run the build in a
RVM-managed environment" option under the "Build Environment" section.
Click the checkbox, then type in the Ruby implementation name in the
text box. The implementation name is of the form `RUBY[@GEMEST]`. See
[the RVM documentation](http://rvm.io/rubies/installing/) and the output
of `rvm list known` for possible values.
