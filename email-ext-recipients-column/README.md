  

This plugin allows you to add a column showing the recipients configured
in email-ext-plugin for every project.

## Usage

Create a brand new View or edit an old one and just add the column
"Email Ext Recipients" from the list.

If data cannot be obtained for a certain project, then "No data" will
stand in the corresponding row and column. (Usually due to an
error/exception in retrieving the information)

If the Email-ext-plugin is not enabled for a certain project, then
"Disabled" will stand in the corresponding row and column.

**Important - in order to use this plugin you must have the **
**[Email-ext-plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Email-ext+plugin)**
**installed.**
