Pushes a project to Cloud Foundry or a CF-based platform (e.g. Stackato)
at the end of a build.

## Usage

You will find the plugin in the list of post-build actions in your
build's configuration page.  
(Note: as of version 2.1, the plugin is also available as a build step)

![](docs/images/post_build_action.png)

Enter your target URL and your credentials, then test your connection to
make sure you won't have problems during the build. Check the "Allow
self-signed certificate" if you're using a Stackato micro cloud, or any
other PaaS without signed SSL certificates.

If your application already has a manifest.yml in its root directory,
you can leave the “Read app info from manifest.yml” checked. Unchecking
it will reveal additional settings that you will need to fill out.

That’s it! Start a new build, and your application will be pushed at the
end of it.

### Advanced

#### Services

You can specify services that will be bound to your app, either in the
manifest file or in the Jenkins config. However, this only binds
existing services, it does not create them.  
You can either create the services beforehand manually, or use the
"Create services before pushing" option.

#### Proxy

The plugin will push applications through the proxy used by Jenkins. You
can change these settings in Manage Plugins → Advanced → Proxy
configuration.

#### Token Macros

You can use [Token
Macros](http://localhost:8085/display/JENKINS/Token+Macro+Plugin) in any
configuration field that accepts a string. This allows you to use
[Jenkins' environment
variables](https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/env-vars.html/) as well as any
token generated by other plugins, such as the [Git
Plugin](http://localhost:8085/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin).  
For example, you can set your application name to:

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
#{JOB_NAME}-#{GIT_REVISION}
```

### Pipeline DSL

**Declarative Pipeline (minimal configuration)**

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
pushToCloudFoundry(
  target: 'api.local.pcfdev.io',
  organization: 'pcfdev-org',
  cloudSpace: 'pcfdev-space',
  credentialsId: 'pcfdev_user'
)
```

**Minimal configuration with explicit manifest file**

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
 pushToCloudFoundry(
  target: 'api.local.pcfdev.io',
  organization: 'pcfdev-org',
  cloudSpace: 'pcfdev-space',
  credentialsId: 'pcfdev_user',
  manifestChoice: [manifestFile: 'path/to/manifest.yml']
 )
```

**Inline manifest with service creation and binding**

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
pushToCloudFoundry(
  target: 'api.local.pcfdev.io',
  organization: 'pcfdev-org',
  cloudSpace: 'pcfdev-space',
  credentialsId: 'pcfdev_user',
  selfSigned: true,
  servicesToCreate: [
    [name: 'mysql-spring', type: 'p-mysql', plan: '512', resetService: true]
  ],
  manifestChoice: [
    value: 'jenkinsConfig',
    appName: 'hello-spring-mysql',
    memory: 512,
    instances: 2,
    services: ['mysql-spring'],
    envVars: [
      [key: 'FOO', value: 'bar']
    ],
    appPath: 'test-apps/hello-spring-mysql/target/hello-spring-mysql.war'
  ]
)
```

 

### Changelog

#### Version ~~2.3.0~~ 2.3.1 (June 24, 2018)

-   Fixes [
    JENKINS-31208](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-31208) -
    Getting issue details... STATUS   Support variable expansion in
    token macros.

#### Version 2.2.0 (October 9, 2017)

-   CF Java Client dependency upgraded to
    [2.2.0.RELEASE](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client/releases/tag/v2.20.0.RELEASE)

-   Fixes  [
    JENKINS-46049](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-46049) -
    Getting issue details... STATUS

#### Version 2.1.1 (August 8, 2017)

-   Bugfix for communicating to CloudFoundry API endpoints over plain
    http (see 2.1 release notes)
-   Can also specify port (use `cloudfoundry.api.target:12345`,
    `http://cloudfoundry.api.target:12345`, or
    `https://cloudfoundry.api.target:12345`)

#### Version 2.1 (August 5, 2017)

-   Re-enabled support for Cloudfoundry over unsecure http
    (use `http://cloudfoundry.api.target` instead of
    just `cloudfoundry.api.target`)
-   Cloudfoundry push is now available as a build step in addition to
    the post-build action
-   The build step is also available as a pipeline step
    (`pushToCloudFoundry`)

#### Version 2.0 (July 29, 2017)

-   The plugin is now based on cf-java-client 2.
-   Minimum Java version raised to 1.8 (due to lambdas)
-   Pushes are implemented by
    calling `org.cloudfoundry.operations.applications.Applications.pushManifest`.
    This should hopefully ensure the behaviour is as close as possible
    to calling `cf push` via the CLI
-   As a result of using the cf push approach,
    the `Reset app if already exists` setting is now a no-op.
-   Now uses the plugin-first classloader instead of shaded
    cf-java-client jar
-   Requires accessing the cloudfoundry api over https. Ignoring ssl
    validation errors is still an option, but plain http is not.

#### Version 1.5 (October 21, 2015)

-   Add plugin timeout parameter. This lets you set the timeout before
    the plugin marks the build a failure, independently from the target.
    This is similar to the "client timeout" option of the cf client.
-   Updating the environment variables of an existing app will no longer
    overwrite existing variables. This is the behavior of the cf client.

#### Version 1.4.4 (September 30, 2015)

-   Fix temporary directory not being deleted.
-   Fix exception when using a memory value without a unit.
-   Add support for more memory units (All units from [the CF
    documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#memory)).
-   Ignore unknown macro token in environment variables, to allow dollar
    signs without escaping.

#### Version 1.4.3 (September 17, 2015)

-   Add support for pushing an app with a non-default stack.

#### Version 1.4.2 (August 24, 2015)

-   Fix ClassCastException on push in some cases.
-   Fix "Could not read JSON" error hiding the true error coming from
    the target.
-   Fix backwards compatibility with the saved configuration of older
    versions.

#### Version 1.4.1 (July 21, 2015)

-   Fix temporary files not being correctly deleted at the end of a
    push.

#### Version 1.4 (June 11, 2015)

-   Add an option to create services before the push of the application.
-   The default domain for application URIs is now queried from the
    target, instead of calculated from its URL.

#### Version 1.3.3 (May 28, 2015)

-   Fix \`WsContainerProvider not a subtype\` crash that would happen on
    some Jenkins instances.

#### Version 1.3.1 (Apr 21, 2015)

-   Fix the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException that happened using older
    versions of Java.
-   Add additional stack trace info in case of unknown or CF exception.
-   Internal changes.

#### Version 1.3 (Mar 9, 2015)

-   Add support for [Token
    Macros](http://localhost:8085/display/JENKINS/Token+Macro+Plugin) in
    configuration fields that accept a string.
-   The behavior of the \`no-route\` option has been changed in
    accordance to Cloud Foundry docs. It will now unbind every route
    attached to the app.
-   The \`path\` option of a manifest file will now be relative to the
    location of the manifest file. (This is important when using a
    custom manifest file location)

#### Version 1.2 (Feb 16, 2015)

-   Add support for pushing an app through a proxy.
-   The plugin now uses credentials from the [Credentials
    Plugin](http://localhost:8085/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Plugin)
    instead of text fields.
-   Support for custom manifest file location.

#### Version 1.1 (Jan 23, 2015)

-   Add support for distributed jobs.
-   Add support for multi-apps manifest.yml files. (They will be pushed
    in order, but the entire build will be marked as failed if one app
    fails)
-   Fix UI bug where services configured would not show up on reload.
-   Print more useful info in case of unknown CloudFoundryException.

#### Version 1.0.3 (Nov 17, 2014)

-   Initial release.
