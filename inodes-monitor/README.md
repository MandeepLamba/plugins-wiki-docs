This plugin offers a way to monitor inodes consumption for Jenkins
nodes. Like other node monitors, it can be used to automatically, and
temporarily, take a node offline when there is not enough inodes left.

### Screenshots

Under the `/computer` url, you will see a new column added after you
install the plugin:

if you open the /computer/configure page, you can set the percentage
above which a problematic node should be taken offline until you resolve
the issue (defaulting to 95%):
