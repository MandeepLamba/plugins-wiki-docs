This plugin sends messages to an MQ, e.g. RabbitMQ whenever a build is
started and finished. It also sends a message when a build enters and
leaves the queue.  
By extending this plugin, developers can add events for when to send
messages to MQ.

### General information

The plugin connects to an MQ, e.g. RabbitMQ and sends messages during
specific events. In its first version, the messages are sent when:

-   A build is added to the queue
-   A build leaves the queue (either to be built or is cancelled)
-   A build starts
-   A build finishes (either when the build is finished or when it is
    aborted)

The basic use case is for other systems to interact with Jenkins. An
example is a system that triggers a build using the rest API of
Jenkins,  
then waits for the build to finish. The system wants to present
information about these builds. The alternative to listening to an MQ is
for the system  
to continuously poll Jenkins for information of the build status.

Other events can be added to the plugin by extending it.

### Message format

##### Entering queue

"state":"QUEUED","url":"http://urltojenkins:port/jenkins/job/myjob/","parameters":"\["parameter1":"parametervalue","parameter2":"otherparametervalue"\]"

##### Leaving queue

"state":"DEQUEUED","DEQUEUE\_REASON":"BUILDING","url":"http://urltojenkins:port/jenkins/job/myjob/","parameters":{"parameter1":"parametervalue","parameter2":"otherparametervalue"}

##### Build started

"state":"STARTED","url":"http://urltojenkins:port/jenkins/job/myjob/buildnumber/","causes":{"UserIdCause",
"Started by user Bunny
McQueen"},"parameters":{"parameter1":"parametervalue","parameter2":"otherparametervalue"}

##### Build finished

"state":"COMPLETED","url":"http://urltojenkins:port/jenkins/job/myjob/buildnumber/","status":"SUCCESS","parameters":{"parameter1":"parametervalue","parameter2":"otherparametervalue"}

### Settings

![](docs/images/rmq.png)

The settings are all MQ-related. The only required settings are the MQ
URI, for where to find the MQ server and Exchange name,  
for where to send the messages inside the MQ. The other settings are all
optional and related to your MQ setup, you can read more  
about them at e.g. the RabbitMQ site here: [RabbitMQ
docs](https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html)
