This plugin allows you to add columns to your Views with data from the
[Violations
Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Violations).

  
With the help of this plugin you can create columns containing data for
the following types taken from the Violations Plugin:

-checkstyle

-codenarc

-cpd

-cpplint

-csslint

-findbugs

-fxcop

-gendarme

-jcreport

-jslint

-pep8

-perlcritic

-pmd

-pylint

-simian

-stylecop

This plugin can also add a column that counts the number of failed tests
for every job in the View.

## Usage

Create a brand new View or edit an old one and just add the columns you
need from the list.

If data cannot be obtained for a certain job, then N/A will stand in the
corresponding row and column.

Important - in order to use this plugin you must have the Violations
Plugin installed.
