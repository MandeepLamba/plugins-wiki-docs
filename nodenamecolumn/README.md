Adds column showing node name and can be configured in views.

This simple plugin adds a Node Name selection when configuring the
columns for views.

### Change Log

##### Version 1.2 (21-October-2014)

-   Read the assigned label directly from the Job instance rather than
    deserializing the job from disk for every page render (which is a
    major performance issue)

##### Version 1.1 (17-April-2010)

-   Fix NPE for jobs not tied to a node (JENKINS-6286)

##### Version 1.0 (1-Feb-2010)

-   Initial release.
