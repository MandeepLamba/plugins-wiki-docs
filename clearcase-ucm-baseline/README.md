Allows using ClearCase UCM baselines as the input of builds: When using
this SCM, users will be asked at build-time to select the baseline on
which the job has to work.

To use this plugin, you need to install the [ClearCase
Plugin](http://localhost:8085/display/JENKINS/ClearCase+Plugin) since it
relies on it (more precisely, the global configuration data is shared
between the two plugins):

# About this plugin

This plugin adds a new **ClearCase UCM baseline** SCM mode to the
projects: It's then possible for a build to start based on a ClearCase
UCM baseline (composite or not) without playing with config specs or
having to modify the job configuration. When using the **ClearCase UCM
baseline** SCM mode, the user will be presented with the following
screen when starting a new build:

![](docs/images/clearcase-ucm-baseline-02.png)

After having clicked on the **Build** button of this screen, a new view
will be created to retrieve the whole content of the selected baseline
and the job will be able to work on this data, as usually.

# A use case behind this plugin

Let's say your development team is using Hudson as their continuous
integration system while developing a new J2EE application. They have
defined a new job in Hudson, which runs twice a day (at noon and at
night) to frequently ensure everything works fine. This job may do the
following:

1.  It gathers the application source code using the [ClearCase
    Plugin](http://localhost:8085/display/JENKINS/ClearCase+Plugin).
2.  It builds the application from the source code using the [RAD
    Builder
    Plugin](http://localhost:8085/display/JENKINS/RAD+Builder+Plugin).
3.  It runs the unit tests (thank you JUnit).
4.  It deploys the application on a production-like application server
    (for example using the [WAS Builder
    Plugin](http://localhost:8085/display/JENKINS/WAS+Builder+Plugin)),
    ensuring everything is deployed properly (e.g. JDBC resources are
    available, etc.).
5.  It triggers the execution of non-regression testing.
6.  At one moment or another in this build-flow (depending on your point
    on view), it creates a new ClearCase baseline.

After some time, once the application has been extensively tested and
when most of its functionalities are considered as ready-for-production,
one of the baseline is promoted to the RELEASED level. It means your
infrastructure team will gather this baseline and deploy on the
production environment what has to be deployed.  
Hey, minute, we're talking about deployment, right? Something has
already been defined in the previously described job to do that! It has
run many many times, so it can also surely be used to perform the
deployment on the production environment, no? This is when the ClearCase
UCM Baseline Plugin comes in: It allows you to reuse what has already
been defined in Hudson but to work on promoted baselines rather than
working on the HEAD revision.

# User guide

There's not much to say here, refer to the inline help (the little
question marks at the right of the jobs' configuration screen) to get
detailed information:

-   Set the SCM to be **ClearCase UCM baseline**. You'll notice that it
    has no parameters (screenshot below).
-   If not already done, activate the **This build is parameterized**
    option.
-   Add one (and only one) **ClearCase UCM baseline** parameter and fill
    the various fields.
-   You're done!

Now, when starting a new build, the user will be offered with a
drop-down list allowing him to chose one of the baselines based on the
job's settings:

Some questions and their answers regarding the configuration of this
plugin:

-   What if I define the SCM to be **ClearCase UCM baseline** but
    without adding the required parameter?  
    *The build will fail, explaining why.*
-   What if I define the SCM to be **ClearCase UCM baseline** but adding
    more than one **ClearCase UCM baseline** parameter?  
    *The build will fail explaining why.*
-   What if I don't set the SCM to be **ClearCase UCM baseline** but
    adding some **ClearCase UCM baseline** parameter?  
    *Here also, the build will fail explaining why.*
-   What if I create a string parameter named **ClearCase UCM baseline**
    (using the **ClearCase UCM baseline** mode)?  
    *The build will fail, explaining why.*

# Roadmap

# Known limitations

-   The plugin will not work when using it for a job which is not tied
    to a specific node: It won't be able to get the baselines list
    before the build is actually assigned to a node.
