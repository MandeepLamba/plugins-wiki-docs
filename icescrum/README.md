iceScrum is a web application for using Scrum while keeping the spirit
of a collaborative workspace. It also offers virtual boards with
post-its for sprint backlog, product backlog and
others. [https://www.icescrum.com](https://www.icescrum.com/)Continuous
integration plays an important role in agile development. iceScrum
integrates build information from Jenkins so you don’t have to leave
iceScrum in order to check that your builds pass.

This integration also allows traceability between stories and the builds
in which they are implemented.

See the corresponding iceScrum documentation:
<https://www.icescrum.com/documentation/continuous-integration-2/>[](https://www.kagilum.com/documentation/icescrum-pro/continuous-integration/)

iceScrum plugin for Jenkins is supported on iceScrum R6\#6 or greater.
