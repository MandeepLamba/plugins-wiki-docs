This plugin enables Jenkins to load test output from
[JavaTest](http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/JCPtools2/)
test harness, which is commonly used by TCK tests for various JSRs.

The plugin works much like the JUnit plugin, and provides historical
trend and other detailed views of the test result.
