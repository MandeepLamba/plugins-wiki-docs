This plugin auto-installs
[ChromeDriver](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver) to
every slave.This is useful if you run Selenium tests on your Jenkins by
using Google Chrome, which requires this separate platform-specific
binary to be downloaded and available.

This plugin does not have any configuration. It will automatically kick
in when a slave becomes online.
