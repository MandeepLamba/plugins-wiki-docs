## Purpose

This plugin enables slave and per build logging. Each build will get a
single log file, collected from the master and the possible slave.

This plugin is intended for remote debugging/tracing other plugins where
a traditional debugger is unavailable.

## Setup

In the configuration page enter those logger names to be logged. These
logs will end up in their respective build folders.

Â 
![](docs/images/loggingpluginscreen.png)

Check the "Enable poll logging" if logging should be in the polling
phase. This log will end up in a special folder called "poll-logging" in
the job folder.

Java Logger

The plugin only works with the java.util.logging.Logger. Use it as you
normally would.

## Logs

Each build, run with this plugin enabled, gets a menu item called
"Logging". This links to the log of this particular build.

The poll logs are available from the projects main page.

## Jenkins Job DSL
