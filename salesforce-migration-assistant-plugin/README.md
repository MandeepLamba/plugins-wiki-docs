This plugin automatically deploys metadata changes (Apex Classes, Apex
Triggers, Visualforce Pages, etc.) to a Salesforce organization based on
differences between two commits in Git.

See the github
[wiki](https://github.com/jenkinsci/salesforce-migration-assistant-plugin/wiki)Â for
information on how to configure the plugin.
