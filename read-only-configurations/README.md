Note: the [Extended Read Permission
Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Extended+Read+Permission+Plugin)
provides a somewhat similar function, merely activating a permission
already defined in Jenkins core and honored by jobs and various plugins
providing configurable objects (but currently not the Jenkins global
configuration).
