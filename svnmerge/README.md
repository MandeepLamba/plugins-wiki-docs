This plugin automates feature/personal branch workflow on Jenkins by
providing one-click branching/rebasing/integration or automated
rebasing/integration.

For general discussion of feature branches in Subversion, see [Online
subversion
book](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.branchmerge.commonpatterns.html)
or [articles](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/quicksvnbranch.html).
Feature branches allow developers to commit their changes without
worrying too much about regressions, and this Jenkins plugin assists
teams to deploy this more easily.

# Features

## One-click feature branch setup

You can have Jenkins create a branch in Subversion and create a job for
it (by copying from the trunk build job) just by one click of a button.

To do this, first enable the feature branch support in the job that
currently builds the trunk by clicking "Accept Integration from
Subversion feature branches." This creates an action on the left to
manage/create new feature branches. From this page, you can create a
branch and the job:

Alternatively, you can manually create a branch, create a job, and
enable the feature branch support after the fact by clicking "This
project builds a Subversion feature branch" and specifying the trunk
job.

## Integration status visualization

Jobs that build feature branches get two actions on the left. One shows
the status of the integration, meaning what changes in the branch has
already been integrated into the trunk, the revision number of the
integration commit, what trunk CI job has built it, etc.

The up arrow in the build history indicates builds whose output has been
integrated upstream.

## One-click rebase

The other action in the project top page allows you to manually initiate
the "rebase" action, which is a Subversion merge command to pull in the
latest changes from the trunk into your feature branch, thereby
synchronizing the branch with the trunk.

![](docs/images/rebase.png)

In addition to rebasing with the tip of the trunk, this UI allows you to
pick arbitrary revision to rebase, in terms of the known build â€” for
example, you can rebase with the revision that was resulted in the last
stable trunk build, thereby eliminating any risk that you pick up
regressions into your branch.

(This also works with the build promotion plugin and others that can
define their own permalinks.)

## Automatic rebase

Aside from manually performing rebase, you can also make rebase a part
of the build. This can ensure that your feature branch always stay close
to the trunk, thereby reducing the pain of the merge down the road.

![](docs/images/auto-rebase.png)

Specifying the build to rebase to is a good way to control the frequency
of the rebase. For example, imagine using the build promotion plugin on
the trunk, and promote a build as "rebase point" about once a day
(contingent on passing QA jobs.) Since the last "rebase point" build
would only change about once a day, the automatic rebase would be no-op
most of the time but only once a day.

## Automatic integration

In addition to initiate integration manually, you can also make Jenkins
do integration automatically. This can be used as a publisher, as seen
below:

![](docs/images/auto-integrate.png)

If you enable this in a project, you'll be automatically integrating
with every successful build. This is useful for personal branches, where
you'll keep on committing to this branch and let Jenkins verify the
change before it gets integrated into the trunk.

This feature gets more interesting in combination with the build
promotion. You can keep producing CI builds quickly, then use other jobs
to verify its quality, and as a promotion action you can make the
integration happen. This matches more closely with the typical
integration workflow.

## Tips

-   Automatic rebase and integration actions can be configured in the
    upstream job so they are automatically configured on feature branch
    jobs when created by the plugin.
-   You can avoid the so-called Subversion "keep-alive-dance" which
    triggers unnecessary builds of the feature branch by excluding the
    commit messages matching
    `Rebasing with the integration commit that was just made in rev\.\d+`
    (see [this
    discussion](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Subversion+Merge+Plugin?focusedCommentId=82020693#comment-82020693)).
