## Who is this plugin for?

It's for users of Redgate's SQL Change Automation. The tools help users
manage databases alongside application code in agile processes. The [SQL
Change Automation](http://www.red-gate.com/sca) tool plugs into Jenkins
to enable continuous integration for your SQL Server databases.

## What does it do?

It's an easy way to build, test, synchronize and publish databases using
Jenkins:

1.  Build - builds your database from a [Redgate source controlled
    database](http://www.red-gate.com/sqlsourcecontrol/) to a NuGet
    package.
2.  Test - generates test data using Redgate's [SQL Data
    Generator](http://www.red-gate.com/sql-data-generator/) and runs
    tSQLt tests against the package.
3.  Sync - updates an existing database with the latest version in the
    package.
4.  Publish - publishes the package to a NuGet feed ready for
    deployment.

## What are the prerequisites?

You'll need to install:

-   Redgate's [SQL Source
    Control](https://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-source-control/)
    or [SQL Change Automation](https://www.red-gate.com/sca)Â so you can
    generate a project

Free trial versions of these tools are available.
