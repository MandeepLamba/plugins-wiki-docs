Â   
Alternatives and yum are run via sudo, therefore appropriate sudoers
setup is requited (including switching off tty requirement which is
turned on by default or run pseudo-tty e.g. by including -t param in ssh
command).  
Example setup:  

**/etc/sudoers.d/jenkins**

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
#Defaults    requiretty
User_Alias JENKINS = test_user
Cmnd_Alias OPENJDK_INSTALL = /usr/sbin/alternatives, /usr/bin/yum
JENKINS ALL = NOPASSWD: OPENJDK_INSTALL
```
