# CloudCoreo DeployTime

Allows for inspection of cloud objects at time of deploy against
contexts on the CloudCoreo platform. Fails builds that are in violation
of user-defined CloudCoreo context rules.

## Requirements

-   [CloudCoreo](https://www.cloudcoreo.com/) account
-   A connected cloud account for the CloudCoreo account

## Usage

1.  Create a CloudCoreo access key in your CloudCoreo account
2.  In Jenkin's global configuration settings, add a team and fill out
    all necessary fields
3.  Under "Build Environment" for job configuration, select "CloudCoreo
    Enabled for Workload Analysis" and choose a team
4.  Add a post-build action for "Analyze CloudCoreo Results"

## Tips & Customizations

Use CloudCoreo to edit the contexts for which new deployed objects are
checked against. You can edit the default rules, adding to them or
defining a new default context altogether, as well as individually
select rules within a broader context.
