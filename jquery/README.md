This plugin is a library plugin for other plugins to share common
jQuery. It also allows users to use jQuery on each view
descriptions.Because Jenkins uses prototype.js in the core, you cannot
use the standard '$' object to access jQuery. Instead, use the 'Q'
object, or use a new scope created by a function to re-bind '$' to
jQuery safely, as follows:

This plugin puts jQuery into every page rendered by Jenkins, so
developers of other plugins need not do anything special to make it
work.

If Jenkins is 1.453 or later, Jenkins will not allow JavaScript in
description. You will need ["Anything Goes"
formatter](http://localhost:8085/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=60915753).
