This plugin as well as the Deltacloud API project is **abandoned**,

This plugin allows to use [Delta Cloud
API](http://incubator.apache.org/deltacloud/) for provisioning new
slaves and therefore allows you to decouple your Jenkins instance from
cloud provider

**Credits:** Kohsuke and his [EC2
plug-in](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Amazon+EC2+Plugin), a lot
of thing were inspired by this plug-in
